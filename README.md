### Requirement
* pytorch 1.0 (checked at 1.0) 
* opencv 
* numpy 
* easydict
* Python3

### Prepare data 
WIDER face dataset is used. see the S3FD.pytorch git for more detail.


### Train
You can use 
``` 
python train.py 
``` 

Refer the train.py files to check the arguement.
Our setting was

```
"--batch_size 16 --lr 0.001" 
```

### Evaluation on WIDER Dataset
You should complie the bounding box function. Type
```
python3 bbox_setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

Then run 
```
python3 wider_test.py
```

### Demo 
you can test your image from
```
python3 demo.py
```
